# Jam Launch Addon

This Godot 4 addon simplifies the deployment and hosting of multiplayer games.
It includes scripts for bootstrapping multiplayer games and an editor plugin
that facilitates deployment into the Jam Launch cloud.

Most features require a Jam Launch account. You can sign up for an account
[here](https://app.jamlaunch.com).

## Example project

There is an example project that uses this addon
[here](https://github.com/jam-launch/jam-launch-example).

### Try out a deployed version

With a regular Jam Launch account, you can play a deployed version of
the example project [here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/g/e61CshPH-0K).

## Deploy with Jam Launch Credits

Jam Launch credits can be purchased and used to host your project on Jam Launch infrastructure. You only pay for the resources you use, and deployments can be
done in one click from the addon's editor plugin:

## Test locally

If you don't have an account, you can still run games in local hosting mode with
the addon. This allows you to verify game functionality and compatibility with
Jam Launch.
